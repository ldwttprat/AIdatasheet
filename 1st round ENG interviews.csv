I've been using gpt before, I was playing around with it but mostly as a bit of fun and doing a bit of written research on it. I think chatgpt is quite formative in that. Suddenly it's actually useful whereas the other things were more fun, this has a more practical aspect, that's the main difference. M: you were aware of and used gpt before chatgpt? P: Yeah, was using gpt 2 and 3 mostly and a couple older chatbox variations that were so machine like they were funny. But chatgpt became useful and more good that it's not as funny anymore. M: what were some use cases of gpt 2? P: The games we'd play, we'd get various chatbox, we did a game called the daddying game, just like the dating game where you have to pick one of three people you cannot see to go on a date with where you had to choose which chatbox you'd want to be your father. We wrote a paper in 2021 or 22 on how chatbox discuss sexuality and gender identity and gpt 2 or 3 was markedly different from the others. We'd use that in a playful and exploratorive sense.","M: how view of internet has changed since chatgpt arrive, P: probably 10, changed viewpoint in that it can be 10% worse. Because of gen AI explotion it makes me more distrustful of content because people can just generate it straight away. Now I've had more experience with long form text with chatgpt, it makes me more suspicious and think eventually the internet will be loads of chatbox talking to each other, and we're just human puppets curating content generated by machines.

I use it more often than most team members. ,"not yet Have ongoing discussions on how we might integrate it into the team. No real strict policy that I know of. I know chatgpt has an opt out feature so whatever you put in doesn't get added to the data base. Apart from that we're still on the testing side.

I think training is part of the skill set on how to use gen AI effectively and appropriately. I don't know if policy will come out maybe something passed on by a client. Don't know there's a point where we can't run certain things through chatgpt.

I've used chatgpt and asked for similar research projects to the one I've done, it spits out 10 examples, none of the people exist, and not all the journals exist, and the titles of the project don't exist, but gpt 4 starts providing accurate sources. M: like a potential bibliography? P: yes, it says this thing happened and I can prove it with this source. There are some changes I've sen and it brings back to people have recognized it needed to be changed and people have implemented it. So it comes back to people. M: so in the span of a few months you've seen changes to make it more trustworthy? P: yes",,"I see two angles. One it's good in that you can do things quicker. You can summarize data really quick, or feed in a bit of transcript, so you could put your multilingual transcript data and say find similarities or differences, etc. M: In a single go? P: Yeah, 25,000 words and it'll spit some things out. But at the same time I don't know how much I trust it. If I'm going to have to go back and check it should I just do it myself anyway? And there's the idea that will we need new skill sets to incorporate gen AI. I think yes. You have to adapt to the industry, so I think it'll require a bit of retraining and learning how to use these. Google showcased their gen AI changes to workspace and it's all these features you see in Dali and chatgpt in workspace. It's summarizing meeting, create a debrief based on text and can create a presentation out of it. It could speed up the research process but we might also need to take on more work quicker cause we are expected as researchers as well. You can do this in 10% of the time and now your project goes from a month to a week. How that all manifests is a mixed bag.","No, I think the heart of user research is people connecting with one another. Us with researchers connecting with clients and understanding what they want, connecting with our participants to understand what they mean, and connecting back to the clients. You're not going to sit there and have a kickoff meeting with gen AI and not a readout where you see ""I'm going to spend 5 minutes on this cause you think this is interesting"". I don't think gen AI saying ""I think it means this"". I think it can describe, but not interpret and I don't think it can run interviews yet. So there's always a possibility. Who knows where it'll go in a year, then you add 10 years to that, but if you have in commercially available quantum computers in the process, then in 20 years, I don't know. I think the singularity might be coming. ","It's not quite the matrix, maybe more in 30-50 years, but if at a certain point tech becomes so powerful, including quantum computing, then why do we need us to do things. So what if we do get replaced for jobs, if there's a bot that can run interviews and manage projects, then let them do it. So what's the point in us? Talking full on universal basic income and we go back to playing instruments and philosophising, basically ancient Greece in the utopian version. The dystopian version is we can never believe anything we see or hear again because we don't know who created it. I think ultimately it needs human involvement to be ethical and legislative measure before it gets out of control. But it's good for quicker reports, so it's a give and take. M: where's your excitement now? P: 4, excited but nervous but ultimately believe in people as a collective to do the right thing. ","At the moment yes [see it as negative] because you see certain signals like Microsoft fired the ethical AI team out of openAI and they're usually very good at inclusivity and ethics, you hear about how chatgpt came to be and it's through outsourcing on places like Kenya with people working on very little money and being exposed to weird and harmful text-based content. I think it needs a balance from academic communities, possibly legislation as well, the EU is pretty on top of legislation for AI initiatives. I'm part of a group who try to create ethical standards for AI. It lacks a moral compass and the company bought openAI firing the people who are meant to be safeguarding it.","The google workspace is most exciting for me. Think it streamlines the more tedious aspects, don't think it should be the final product, always need the human aspect but it's an exciting time to steamline some of that stuff. I do get worried about... how a company how projects get priced and sent on on the assumption that we should be using gen AI, does analysis get cut down by half because they assume we should be using these tools. And whether that leads to increased workloads and whether the human brain can take on a project in such a small amount of time and easily switch because we have more tools.

Communicating with clients, in China it's WeChat. Even within the team we have wechat, right now I'm not in the same country as my team so it's very useful.

When I was study we had to study neural networking, at the time we had to write the programming and train the computer, it was 20 years ago. When I was 20 something, that's the first time I got to play with the AI thing or the concept. At the time we wrote the coding and gave the computer a bunch of coffee cups to do neural network training and then gave the computer other cups to have the computer determine whether it's a coffee cup or not. The idea of AI or machine learning, whatever the algorithm, the idea is the same. We have an input, a data base, and a certain algorithm and we have the output. It's interesting to see how it's gone a long way",,"Not long ago, about a month. It was on a social media post. I saw it and gave it a try and started to play with it. Now I use chatgpt very often. M: everyday? P: yes M: what's the last time you used it? P: an hour ago, M: what did you do with it? P: I was sending an email to a client, used another chatbox claude or sage, told the chatbox my intention what I wanted to say and can you write this for me and it gave me something, and I gave corrections. I think it's quite useful for us where English is not our native language so sometimes we make grammatical errors, minor errors. I think this is a very quick way to do proof reading, or having another way of saying things. M: do you give prompts in Chinese too? P: yes I have M: when did you start using this tool? P: after chatgpt, I started with chatgpt and then started this one. I have a friend, who works with Apple, because this app is not open source yet, and he shared it with us, it actually combines 4 or 5 chatbox, including chatgpt. I switch between chatbox to see which one is better, because I know some are better at dealing with multiple languages, some better at logic. M: and this tool brings them all together? P: Yes","Yes, because the chatbox, Siri thing, is not a new idea, it was already existing. At the time it was very limited, not as natural as if talking to a person. What makes it different from other AI things is that it's very easy, like you're talking to a person. It's really like you're chatting. I think that's the underlying feeling. M: has the way you use the internet changed? P: I think I use google last, Google has too much ads there now. And google lacks the interaction like you're talking to someone. And when you ask google something you have to be very precise. I don't have to be very precise [with chatgpt], because when I ask on Google I have to be very precise. Sometimes my way of thinking is not very organized, that's what I find fascinating about chatgpt. I use chatgpt or chatbox as another person or assistant, sometimes I want to discuss something and type that I'm thinking about something but not sure how to phrase it, and it'll give me something back. It can help me to continue my work, like a person by my side. This is something Google cannot do, of course it makes mistakes. When we first started we found it cannot tell whether 7 is a prime number. M: what about the other chatbox you use? P: Sometimes correct, sometimes not. It's like a person, sometimes it makes mistakes. The algorithm behind it is like logic, so it generates the answer based on the logic. When you ask something about right or wrong you might not get a correct answer but if you ask about some phenomena or something they can describe I think that's something they're better at",n/a,n/a,"8, still not an expert. ",8,,,,,,,"It'll make our work faster. Like quickly generating a new work cloud, or summarize or keywords, or generate some images. I think those things, it's useful. I was chatting with my team and showed them the experiment we're doing with chatgpt. In some projects, the participant has to image putting a device in my room or maybe in another style, would it fit better. They have to use their imagination, but with this kind of tool, the image doesn't have to be very accurate, we can just type in the words and something comes out. Sometimes it'll be easier for people to carry on the discussion when they look at something physical and tangible. It'll definitely make things faster when we use this tools in a smart way. M: would client expect more or cheaper from you? P: Not sure, but when chatgpt came out, I was talking to a client and she was telling me they were having the same discussion about whether the job of a researcher will be replaced. Now we can still be certain that the mindset of research won't be replaced, it can help us do analysis. The machine cannot know how to get insights out, I think that's what clients value most. It's possible that clients will say ""hey you can do things faster"" but it's hard to say. It's a reasonable argument if clients say so.",,"Yes, but not as freely as me because they're in China.

What I've been using so far is things we create for testing or proofreading things that aren't subject to privacy or confidentiality. That's still a big question. My team and I think if we want to use this as a tool officially, we need to have something on our own, whether we can own the server or write our own algo to protect the security.

It's not something we can avoid, it's there and growing rapidly. It's everywhere, so we need to be aware of it, not ahead of it, but aware and know how to use it.

In 5-10 years I wonder what people will be doing. M: impact on printing press, loom? P: something as big as the printing machine, it's a huge comet really.","I don't see it as Terminator kind of world, but I see it in a negative way because it makes people think less on their own. Is it convenient, yes, but it makes them less human in a way. I don't see AI taking over but it makes people think less, which is sad. M: what happens to thinkers in this world? P: I don't know. I can't even picture what the world will be like in 10 years with this kind of thing. I think it's going to be just artisans and craftsmanship. Those people will be more valued, which is in a good way. I think today the wealth is distributed in a screwed up way, like teachers should be paid more cause it's such and important job, but people in finance make a lot of money but what are they doing. Essential workers should be paid more, it might even help more with gen AI, those things could be taken by AI and essential work needs to be done by humans. It could work in a positive way in that sense. M: where it reaches critical mass and turns the other way. Like people going back and learning how to farm. P: yeah","I think I have to read more, I have to make sure I'm up to date with all happening. I haven't done much research on it, I'm just using it, but because it's something that can directly impact work, it's something I should look into, see its strengths, how we can use it and take advantage of it before others do. It's something I need to do. M: I see the value of someone who is a purist, hasn't been influenced by outside info but just using the tool. P: It's just amazing. Do I like it? Not really, I'm an analogue person, I don't even use a digital watch. For a person like me it's just way too much. But it is what it is, I think it'll be more advanced, you can't stop it, so finding ways to live with it and how to use it in a smart way. To use it you need to know what it is and what it can do, so I need to do more research on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thinking about my daughter for her it's normal she can look for videos or look it up all the time, when we were young we had to wait till it was available on TV or something. Especially, everything is available immediately, the knowledge you can look it up immediately. I think it's difficult to imagine a world without this possibility.

Was mostly curious how difficult it would be to start using it. There's quite some technology. It's different but the world of the metaverse or the crypti, crypto baluta these are all technology of the years, but sometimes it's not easy to get into it. Crypto valuta for example, I think we tried it out just to understand the process but in order to apply there's many steps you need to go through in order to create the account to do it. It's not so easy, not every person can say I want to open it, tomorrow I do this and it's done. Same with the metaverse, there are things you can easily do, there are a few programs you can easily do. But if you really want to go into it, you have to create this account, you also need to have your crypto valuta for some things. It's complex. I thinnk that was the first thing, right now is this something that you... I don't know, just to understand is this something easy. It's fine to access it. That would be the main difference, if it's easily accessible a lot of people will adapt to it. I dont' feel, the crypto valuta for example, a lot of people are also there, but it's not like the total population or most has adopted it. Same with the metaverse, you hear things, but it's not like the... not yet, you never know. Right now with the generative AI I see some things, it's easier for people to use it.

Creating in research work or workshops you might have, see if in one click they generate the summary of it. That's really powerful or creating, diagrams, mind maps and these kinds of things with ideas. That's where I can see it's really powerful.

It can support in translation, analysis of a lot of data, but still I don't see it like it could do the moderation. You need the non-verbal behaviors are very important, the human to human relation and I think the final analysis, that's still something a human needs to do to understand the context. You can analyze the data, you can draw conclusions, but in order to see how you can apply it, you need to understand many aspects. You have the business, the human aspect, you have the context. I think you still need the researcher to do this final step. I don't think that can be replaced, but a lot of things can go more quicker for some research. Building a protocol, it takes time right now, it would be much quicker to make changes during prototypes. AI can write code, right? You can say... even researchers certain times can do certain things because you don't need developer. Things can go quicker, I don't think it can replace the research. I don't feel there's a problem there. It can support many things. Of course there will be a lot of research on the topic, there's still a joke there as well. And to make it user friendly and all the applications. There's many applications there as well, so it can open up new fields, that's interesting. ","I don't see the two phases. The thing I see that's difficult is if you do moderated research. If unmoderated, it could maybe do it automatically. but the moderated, I think the face to face contact. I think you need a human to interpret the verbal and nonverbal communication. There's facial analysis in these things, but still I think there it's diffivult to really substitute. In the prep and analysis part I can see that it's getting replaced. Like I said, the final part, the conclusion of the conclusion, maybe you need someone, a researcher or human to do that final part. To put it into context and see many aspects together. Sometimes if there's tradeoffs, we have decisions, maybe certain solution is better for the business and another is better for the user. What decision would AI make? It's difficult, you need to give it... it's almost like not an ethical decision. Do you give priority to business or person. How would AI decide. Certain things it's better if a human would do that. Because it's not always based on data that you make certain decisions. ",That's really hard,"That's a difficult thing. On the one hand I'm really excited about it, but there's also the side effects. Especially for myself, I'm an adult, I can decide on it. I think it's more, for myself I see the perspective more on the positive side. I think for children, it can be quite dangerous. Or not dangerous, but they are... everything is open right? People that cannot, that don't have the... Like smaller children, they don't know what is good and what is not good. So for them it's more difficult to decide, I think there should be regulations, education on it. For me that's more the negative side. For myself, I see the positive side, I think I can be very interesting new ways of working, shopping, connecting to people. I see that, can be interested. For children, I see the negative side. I'm also a little bit worried on that and how that will evolve. My daughter is 3, in 10 years I think it'll be a huge difference as she's 13. How will it look like? You need to protect a little bit.

I remember 1988 first time I got connected to the internet and 1997 and I still have the feeling of permanent discovering everything. I feel like a student learning a lot of things everyday. Of course, the more time the less learning in terms of... I discover a lot of things, but... Let me think how to explain. The more new technologies get attention of the people, for example AI, I have a feeling that okay, you keep learning like the first time. And for me it's impossible to think, to imagine my life without internet. Absolutely impossible.",,"My background as a researcher starts because in university we call it cyber research in social work and after social work I studied sociology. Meaning social science are in the roots of my diploma. When I was in university I did not have internet access, that's an important point. I was this guy at the library all the time. Meaning, as a researcher, I found on internet the big place to stay because the possibility, the chance to access everything I needed. I remember my first partial paid job, I was like google engineering. Meaning I worked in a foundation, non profit, and my job was just search on google. Because everyone was older than me, there were people asking me, requesting all the time, can you search in the internet this or that all the time. Because they didn't know how to approach to search on google. Because until 1998, 1999, the tool discover things on the internet was yahoo or antavista, directories. Not asking to the machine with the texting, we call prompt. Before we call how to search in the internet. That's the feeling I have as a researcher. I grew up as a researcher asking google, asking search engines. And today, when I realized what is this chatGPT everyone is talking about, I feel I have to start to learn again, because everything I learned before is ok, but now it's time to rethink everything I know. To keep growing as a researcher of course. ","Absolutely yes. Considering that I never had a computer until I was, maybe 25 years when I had my first computer. I only knew how to switch on the electricity. I had no training with computers, everything I learned I learned by myself. Since that moment everything around my personal and professional life, turned around technology. I don't consider myself a tech guy because I don't care how the technology works. This is stuff for engineers or developers, I only care about the results and how people can deal with the technology, with the devices, not the tech. I try every kind of devices I can. M: on scale of 1-10, 1 being you can plug your computer, 10 being the extremem end of that? P: 8 or 9",8,"Things I like, everything. It's difficult to find things I don't like relatedthe internet. Maybe a thing I don't like, I don't know if it's related to the internet or not is connectivity. Connectivity is the reasons because people could not reach the internet. But internet as a concept, as a tool is fantastic, it's wonderful. I don't know what we do with our lives before the internet. I am absolutely deeply about that. If we speak about how people use internet, of course, there's a lot of bad habits and bad stability on the internet. All of this, say a knife, you could use a knife to cut bread, giving bread to your kids, but you can use the knife to kill the neighbor. It's not the knife, it's what you do with the knife. With the internet it's the same, of course we find a lot of really really bad stuff with the internet, but the good things we can reach thanks to the internet are bigger than the bad stuff. Because human beings it's impossible to, it's difficult to separate our behavior will be good and bad, same thing. But with the internet I think gives us better stuff than bad stuff. ","At the very beginning it was like a movie. Like a movie, the car is talking to you, the fridge is talking to you, the watch is talking to you. You have a conversation with the mirror, you can see the news in the mirror or talk with the mirror in the bathroom. But when I experienced the first approach for example with chatGPT I was really, it's like magic. Last year, I think like wow, is it true or this is just a demo and the demo is really really great? Because I think that this chat box is talking to me, it's replying in an accurate way the things I'm asking about. So the first reply I can share with you is wow, it's the best description. After that I can imagine that maybe have been using AI before that it wasn't transparent. I didn't notice that I've been using AI but today we have chatGPT and things like that. I have another kind of feeling, it's like it's clear, it's more true than before. It's like wow I can touch that and I can feel it in a different way than before. Before I guess I got the benefits, but now I'm experiencing, it's different for me. ",Positive,,n/a,,"It was in chatGPT because suddenly a client started talking about chatGPT in terms of be careful because this tool is going to quit our job. This was the argument and they were showing several examples of using, just asking you are a famous writer please describe whatever with whatever style and then chatGPT start replying. When I realized I can ask in Spanish instead of English and it works the same way I was like ""wow, this is really magic"". For me, English is not my mother tongue. I learned English only 10 years ago, before I didn't speak. And for me the language is still a pain, so yes experiencing a tool I can speak, it doesn't matter the language I use to request the machine and the machine reply. Wow this is like magic. Really I feel I'm from the province. Like it's incredible. It was with chatGPT just asking simple stuff. Hey can you tell me when the human beings went to the moon, this kind of stuff. Then I started in a deep, had to explain deep work with chatGPT trying to understand how it works. What kind of requests I put into the chatGPT. And today I'm using chatgpt as a tool tot start my work. Not to finish the work, just start to give me an idea about something and then I finish because sometimes I try to get confused the machine because I ask something I already know it's not true, but I pretend to request, chatGPT really has a creative mind and it doesn't matter if it's true or not, she replies. There is a space to train there.",Obviously a 10,10.00,"Basically it's not my main tool, maybe 50% of the time I am experiencing, I'm trying, I'm researching how the tool can help me. How the tool can give me support. And 50% of the time I'm training the technology to get a result. The results I am expecting are just the first draft of my job. I'm expecting a draft, not an accurate information because sometimes, like yesterday, I was asking the machine to understand the concept of manage app. Instead of searching google, I just chatGPT, manage app expert, explain what is manage app. A formal definition for example. If I don't know about the topic I'm researching I have to trust the tool. Sometimes I'm not sure if it's the correct behavior to just trust or if I should research again with other sources if the info is accurate. So that's the 50% of the time I'm searching, researching, validating. So that's my daily use of the tech, but I'm delighted, I love it.",n/a,,,n/a,,,"The best way I have to learn about chatGPT was to prepare a training a course I recorded one month ago to explain to the designers how to use chatGPT or AI to improve their skillset, the way they have to do the job. The training course is already online in Spanish. I was the teacher. Preparing the training course I had to try different prompts, had to research in the internet how the designers are experiencing with chatGPT and found a lot of people working on that. A lot of prompts, notion documents with a lot of prompts ready to work. And that's one of the paths I followed to learn and I was absolutely delighted. And in a different way, in tik tok. Don't ask me why because I don't know, the algorithm of tik tok has the answer, but I see more videos than expected of people talking about how to use chatGPT or other kinds of artificial intelligence to work as a product designer, to get the value as a product designer and for me, especially in tik tok, I learned how to ask. How to build a prompt, to get the tech ready to get better answers and for me it's absolutely amazing. ","The research I do with chatGPT is personal, in a professional way but personal. It's for me. I am the researcher but also the target. The results of my research I'll use on me and only me. I use the results of this research because mainly I use this tech to clarify concepts, to organize concepts or to extent a concept. To extent a topic. If I need more info, for example I have to do an abstract, okay, help me to do an abstract, give me 5 main ideas. This kind of use is the main for me. It's especially useful when I have to learn about a book, chatGPT can give me an abstract or for example - you are a librarian, tell me the 5 main ideas about a book or that person. For me it's useful, I have to recognize I would never give a public class or conference with that information because I'm not sure if it's accurate. I have my doubts. I don't have that doubt if I search on google, if I search on Google I trust the source. In the results space I choose the source and sources I can trust I know. But with chatGPT I don't have the way to understand if the info is accurate or not. I don't have any source to verify. That's why I use that info just for me. Then I will work and make decision. I would never publish something direct from chatGPT to the internet for example","P believes that it can be used to help reduce the human working hours, and can help facilitate a 4 day work week.","For now we don't talk much about this topic. We are starting, but only with the managers, not all the team because I showed them I did a training course for a client and it's online there's no coming back. We are speaking about how can take advantage of that tech to our processes. Not to run methodologies, but to organize our internal processes for now. But it's not a main conversation","Not yet. M: do you see it being necessary at some point? P: I'm sure it will be because AI is getting main stream and I know in maybe weeks or months there will be people asking I want to do this or that. I'm sure we will need because there are 2 factors, on one side we have remote work, on the other side we have AI. There will be one day where the 2 factors will get together and as companies we need to do better management of the remote work. We will need to understand how can we take advantage of both factors. Maybe to work less in terms of traditional 8 hours per day work. As a company we have a goal to have the 4 days working week and maybe this kind of tech can help us reach that objective better. But not today, it's not a topic of conversation yet. But I'm sure this year maybe the Q2, Q3 it'll be a topic of conversation more than I'm trying to evangelize. It'll be a regular topic I'm sure.

But I don't know the topic I don't criteria to understand if the information is accurate or not. If I know the topic, sometimes more and sometimes less than 5, but 5 is a good answer. ",5,"Personally, 3-5 years ago, before the pandemic, I had the feeling that tech runs faster than me. I didn't have that feeling 10 or 15 years ago. The fact is AI is running faster than previous tech. Sometimes I feel like you have to hurry up or the train will go without you. But I feel absolutely comfortable in the middle of this stress because it reminds me my very first experience with the internet in 1997, 1996. When I was like ""wow I can see the webpage of the Rolling Stones"". We are not still on that conversation and there are 2 factors. I am not sure if they talk about that because I want to. Me and my managers, yes, but with the rest of the team I don't have visibility, I have visibility through the managers. Today this is not the conversation about hehe we can talk to the machine because in the news paper everyone is talking about that. But speaking on how big concepts on how to apply in the research methods, how to apply in the process of the company, how to react when a client asks what about AI for my project. We don't still have that conversation, but I'm sure this year we will have that conversation",,"I don't know because the velocity of this topic is fast. Faster than I expected because 1 month ago, it was like wow it's a magic. But yesterday I was reading Adobe just released a tool to create images just prompting. I have no idea, but I'm sure in 2023, December 31 this year, I'm sure part of our professional life will be changed because of this tech. I'm not sure if we'll speak about all our professional lives, but some I'm sure. ","In general I'm a positive guy, so I tend to think about the positive aspects of using that technology. ","M: what will you do next time you open chatGPT? P: depends because now I'm using chatGPT 4 which a little slower than the previous one. So I'm learning, it's difficult because I'm in chatGPT with a pencil and paper because I organize the way I ask, the way I design the prompt. I'm learning to prompt twice to get better results. Sometimes I imagine myself, the movie HER, sometimes I'm the guest star of HER because I need to think how to ask the tech. With google 20 years ago, I never think how to ask, I just ask. Now I need an additional layer of thinking for myself then ask the tech. Which is different than 20 years ago, because I have to make a significant effort to get better results. Before it was let's ask and google will do the magic, which is interesting because google did. We have that perception that google did because we have the info we needed. 

M: anything else? P: Not really, because every time I have an invitation to speak about AI we speak about the ethics, copyright, the legal problems. Like 20 years ago we had with napster and music, I thought you ask me that because you are young, we already had this discussion 20 years ago. You led the topic with different questions which is good for me. It was difficult for me because it's the first time I have this conversation in English, it's been a challenge for me.

I might be skipping questions, but yesterday there was the announcement from the copilot from microsoft and also google shows the automatic assistant is doing the work for you, building presentation based on simple description or other documents and I just imagine the other part where the robots create the presentation and sent it to you to a client or another stakeholder and the other stakeholder says to their copilot just read it and do the work. So you have to ask yourself what's the point of being human in all of that, so maybe we don't have to do any point at any point. ","In my mind there's a separation... I'm not an expert on that, but based on what I read in last couple of years, I'm separating the current products that were introduced in the last couple months and the future products and concepts of AI. When I think about the current situation, I think it's kind of a hype still and I think regardless of the... it's true that the poroducts that are already here will change the nature of many jobs and will need to introduced to, taken into account in many jobs. My feeling is it's going to be a turbulent time, I don't feel real fear or a strong anxiety because I still feel that the current products, chatGPT and the google ones and other ones are simply based on predicting... these are models that predict the next words that should appear in the document. It's very impressive, but it's still not the broad AI. But when it comes to general AI, this is a concept that could cause anxiety and fear and I still believe we're far from that. But thinking about that I'm concerned and believe it also should be regulated and should be developed with great care which we don't really see happening right now with the products we see. If you see the statements from open AI and Google, they say it's still kind of an experiment and we need help. They do some testing regarding the ethics and all the consequences but it's... I hope it's going to be an interesting learning experience for the future, when the real, really powerful models or products appear. Maybe this experience will help us be more prepared for the more dangerous products that will be created. ",Mixed,,n/a,,,,n/a,"Very low. My perspective is that it caught me off guard in December when I read abou the improvements. I decided, maybe I couldn't really take enough time to play with it. I see my team doing it, so we discuss it and try to find ways to use it in our work as well. Personally I decided I want to understand what deep learning is, and I'm reading a book about deep learning. It was published a couple of years ago so it's not up to date, but I think the concepts are pretty much the same and it's what led to chatgpt. What really interested me is to understand one thing to be impressed by the outcome of the product. I read an interesting opinion, I think by Noah Chomski, and he said he's not really a fan of deep learning. He said it's not really scientific but it's like engineering marvel, but because of the nature of deep learning, it's just this net that's not really well-thought of by humans. It's just the model that somehow generates the results. This was really interesting to me, so I decided to try to understand better how it works. Then I'm going to play with the prompts and so on.",n/a,,,n/a,,,,"My opinion is not really... I didn't think it through well, just exploring it. I've seen some posts saying you can do UX research with just chatgpt and people playing with that. At this point I'll say, the translation is kind of the basic stuff, so it's not really crucial. I wonder if we could use... one thing we're looking for in Poland for example is the automatic transcription, because the current products don't work well enough for Polish language. I know it's been solved for English a long time ago and we've been trying the products once in a while but they didn't work for Polish well enough. It's probably not chatgpt, but it could be some plugins, this is a potential improvement. When it comes to doing research itself, I could imagine some unmoderated research testing being much more advanced with tools like chatgpt. And then you might wonder at what point you get used to those assistance and you add voice and add some avatars and you can do moderated testing with tools like that. But at this point I'm not really sure. I would prefer to believe that both in design and research, the human to human communication will be irreplaceable because it will actually work in a different way. We'll always be aware when talking to a machine. I remember Bob and Gavin talking about this during one of the conferences with Alexa we kind of change the way we talk to the machine because we know how to operate it. It might influence how we talk to other people as well with short comments and so on. But I hope it's always going to be a separate conversation whether I'm talking to a machine or human. It's why I believe that replace user researchers with cost effective AI or avatars or AI researchers will not happen soon or ever. But we'll see. Same for AI design, we've seen where you do a sketch and get a working website, but still it's like with computer generated images. If it's just a piece of content you want to put out quick, it's going to work for you, but if it's something that represents your brand, your unique relationship with customers or users, AI is not going to work well enough. Maybe as a proof of concept, but human eye and human ear will be able to distinguish the real thing, I hope for much longer.","Translation is basic, not really crucial

Auto transcription would be helpful bc current pdts don't work for Polish language

unmoderated testing could become more advanced w tools like chat gpt

Wants to believe that human-human connection will be irreplaceable bc we'll always be aware when talking to a machine; we change the way to talk when talking to Alexa; believes that replacing user research w cost effective AI researchers won't happen soon or never; same for design, AI will work for something to post quick but AI not good enough for branding or connecting","As most of the teams in the creative space, our team plays with generating content, both text content and products like majourney, all the visual ones. I think in one or two research projects they tried out the translation options because I think it's also quite useful for translations. I remember they were very impressed with translations, especially in terms of Polish-English which is not perfect for now. M: has translation been an area that's challenging for using Google translate? P: I know the comment was that it's much better than Google translate. ","Not yet. I think if I was to impose any policy that would be that I would welcome the use any tools like that in our work flow that would help the efficiency of the services we provide, but I think the policy would be to inform the client, or whoever is receiving the outcome of the work that some tool was used to generate some content. I wouldn't imagine that we provide a report to a client and we say we did it while a machine did it. I think that's the thing that comes to my mind at this time. Probably there are more risks I'm not seeing right now but I think with the level of trust we have and the team I have which is not very big, I think that would be the main thing. Our relationship with the client.","Not yet, but anticipates or hopes for one",,"Both in terms of the quality of the insights or what it provides and the formal quality... in the context of the work we do? I would say about 5. I think it's... we can find there are applications of that in our work, and I hope my team finds some of them to not miss the train that is now traveling and speeding up, but I'm not... My strategy regarding our services our company is not to be dependent on products like that.",5,,,"I don't know if it's where we're going but I think it's going to be about the quality of the content and not the quantity. We got to a point where even humans are producing so much content, so it's very difficult. So I think maybe the machines... I'm not very impressed about machines creating more content that is convincing, but I would be impressed with machines helping us figure out which content is the most important one to digest for humans. I'm always thinking about life is speeding for all of us, but it's 24 hours for each human and it's not going to change ever. So the tech has eaten a lot of our mental space and a lot of that time, so being an optimist I hope and think it's not going to be about being able to produce any kind of content. It's not going to be of any value anymore because people want the time to consume that. I think supporting humans be very breif with communicating, I think that would be a better value. So I hope it's going to move in that direction as well. Right now I see we're all in awe, wow what those machines can do. Then you're going to ask yourself they can replicate a lot of things people do now, but if they can replicate them very quickly maybe there's no point in doing all of this. Like I said there's a machine to machine move that can happen, and just the key decisions can be taken by the human, as long as the human can really understand what's happening with the machines. And I think our understanding will have to grow and it's all about responsibility and education and so on. But if we come to a point where those systems act as tools such as... like if we take people from 1950s and show them a tool like figma, they will say it's pure magic and mindblowing, but to us it's just a tool supporting us. I hope the current wave of products may seem magical now, but maybe a few months or next year we're going to understand them better as tools and they're going to help us free some space, some creative space, some thinking space for something more valuable.

Have to be careful about what you're getting as far as information.

As far as the source of info, we've been playing with that as well, just looking up and saying can you help me write this study protocol, I think the best analogy I've heard it's like a teenager, it's already grown, it looks big, you're tempted to treat it like an adult and then it goes and has an emotional breakdown.

It's fine a lot of the time and then suddenly can give you something completely aweful.",1-2,"First I see a lot of research about how best to incorporate it into designing platforms. We see it not necessarily specific tools, but almost all my clients are at different phases of incorporating different aspects of AI into... We do a lot of medical, so if it's scanning medical records and maybe highlighting relevant info for your physician for your GP, that's a project that we did. We have these issues about how to design that in a way that maximizes the benefits without taking away the person's judgement call. You do want the physican to make the judgement call about what data they're going to be using. There's a lot of room for research about what people perceive and what the best way is to communicate what they're getting and not getting. I think the trickiest aspect is that on a lot of parameters it performs better than humans. I want that tool to scan my records cause it's going to give my doctor info that otherwise he's going to miss on the one hand. But it's going to miss info that a doctor won't miss. It makes different mistakes, unlike humans. Our ability to communicate the kind of monitoring the user is going to do on the output is a big challenge. I see research there on how people perceive it. In terms of incorporating into actual research practices, writing protocols, transcribing or having people do the research it as kind of an agent, I mean yeah, definitely. But I don't know if that's the most interesting aspect of it to me. The most interesting aspect is how we help people make the best out of the tech without losing their ability to monitor. You have to redefine your role as a decision maker when presented with data created from these kinds of sources. It's different. We have to create interfaces that support that. And I don't think anybody has really cracked the way to do that yet. So we're getting... I think a challenge from our side is to communicate that gap because we see the developers and tech community sort of in love with it and we have a challenge of communicating information we get from users in our research back to developers and say you're presenting them with this information and the users are perceiving it in a different way. Sometimes we see over trust, sometimes we see under. I don't think that the tech community is necessarily sensitive to how people perceive the output.",,"That's a big question. I think it's going to be everywhere. It's already there and there's going to be more. We're kind of in a fork in the road in terms of are we going to be able to give the next generation of people tools to look at the output critically? I don't even know what those tools need to be yet. In the sense that when I'm getting info, because it's such a black box I don't know where it's coming from. If I had to give my 10 year old son some guidelines, you give it some text this is how you can evaluate whether it's relevant or not. Before it's easy, look for the source, check who said it, that's kind of old world guidelines. I think we need to define them and I hope that the regulation, also just the legal regulations of these things catches up. Otherwise we're going to see a lot of issues. And Israel is an interesting place, it's never quiet and simple here, politically as well. Everything is very immediate here. So it's worrisome to some extent. ","That's almost a personally trait question. I'm positive. At the end of the day I think, if I mentioned before with the internet, it's a ton of info bombarbed. These tools are basically answer how to synthesise the information. This is what we need to make sense mountain of info, obviously a human cannot do that. On the one hand it's almost a natural answer to this huge amount of data we now have. I'm optimistic, I think humans tend to fall on the right side of things, I hope. Keep our fingers crossed. M: you mentioned not having used it for personal use but played around with it a little? P: Yeah","M: any idea for the next thing you might want to pop into chatgpt? P: I think one area I haven't explored but did want to get around to do a little more is replacing the search options there, not just looking for text, but actually seeing if I'm looking for any actual information, how that comes back. And if that's a more useful or concise tool as opposed to google search which is the obvious default. If I'm just looking for any basic piece of info in my daily life, how that works out. 

M: anything else? P: Wasn't sure what you were going for, so I think this kind of met what we discussed. I am happy to roll it forward if you want me to run the interview by anyone on our end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not on the side of the ones that mostly criticize. I think this is one of the best things humans created","I'm an IT engineer so I'm always eager to understand the next breakthrough, the next gadget, the next possible capability of any tech. So I'm very curious on what tech can do for people. So I try things a lot, but I'm not a first adopter in the sense I don't enjoy tech that are mostly faulty. But as fast as it becomes useful I'm there. Having said that, the AI is... I have a very clear opinion. In the 90s when I graduated, my university offered a branch of my graduation called ""the artificial intelligence"". So at that point, it already seemed very attractive. I didn't take that branch of the course but I followed whatever happened in terms of AI since. My opinion is that until I saw chatgpt, it was very clear to me that most of the population over expected what the tech could actually offer. The name AI is very misguiding. It was not intelligent, for me. Siri is a huge disappointment, Alexa as well. I could see the evolution of the tech, but it was never very useful. But with chatgpt I think it definitely changed. When I saw that I told my wife, you need to see this. So that's what I think, that chatgpt is a step that we will remember for a long long time. ",Positive,,n/a,,"I'm very much in all the podcasts and news so I can't really recall the first time I read chatgpt, but it was clearly in the first 24 hours I think that most tech people saw it. And I read about it, I saw the promise and it can chat about any subject in human or natural language way. I went on, registered and tried it. I have no idea what I asked, but I immediately saw it was something very different",10,10.00,,n/a,"It's not that I used it intensely from that point till today but I guess I asked a few things about the world soccer games and things like that. I definitely saw the huge difference between google search and that. So natural language is something that I care about a lot and one interesting point is that I'm portuguese and I always feel like we will get whatever tech in English first, a few other languages and maybe then in Portuguese, but in Brazilian Portuguese. It's always first Brazilian Portuguese because they are 200 million and we are 10 million and there's a huge difference between the 2, a wider difference than UK and US English. So the second thing I tried was in European Portuguese and it mostly worked, not perfectly but it was a double excitement. It worked 100% in Brazilian Portuguese and 90% in European Portuguese so I was quite amazed with that. One thing I was also surprised was I was searching for a drop down box to choose the language, ""where do I change the language to Portuguese"" and then I did what I thought it was and asked do you speak Portuguese and the conversation kept coming on, so I'm impressed.",,n/a,2-3 times a week. ,,"I tend to be look at the news or a number of podcasts. So while I drive or walk, I go to places like Wall Street or tech news of the day, maybe some Portuguese podcasts as well. When I want to dive in I just google things. At this point I either google or chatgpt things. ","We started that internal conversation. We are not only a research organization, we're research and design. I think it will help on some tasks, it will make some tasks much faster like transcripts. That's not much, but for maybe organizing scripts, maybe creating or specifying simple designs, write me a design specification for bank app to access my account or blablabla. It will do that very easily, it'll save a lot of time, but at the same time it will bring the value of simple human tasks to 0. So we'll have to see how our professional services will evolve in terms of their market value. I think it will have a learning curve and I'm not thinking of chatgpt alone, this is just a showcase of the technology, we'll see many other applications. I haven't tried the new bing, but we'll see many other applications that are not chat or chatbox that are other things inside our applications, new applications we don't yet know about. So I think some of the things we do everyday will be automatically done by this kind of tech. Even design things, chatgpt works with text but there are a number AI applications with image like mijourney and things like that. So it's easy to understand that whatever is kind of simple or not going to use a lot of creativity, critical thinking, strategic thinking. A lot of what's not in that pocket will be quite easy to generate. I think we'll see an explosion of applications of this as we've seen in other ways of innovation like mobile or personal computing in the 80s, 90s, or mobile computing in the early 2000s. At some point we saw a big explosion of new applications, that's what we'll see. And in out field, we'll see the figmas and adobes of the world to be able to incorporate those kinds of tech to make our work easier on one side but not billable on the other. ","will make some tasks much faster- transcripts; organizing scripts; creating or specifying simple designs; Example- write design specs for bank app to access accounts; will save a lot of time; it will bring value of simple human tasks close to zero; some services will change in market value; will have a learning curve; will see many other applications that are not chatbots; some things we do everyday will be done by this tech, even design things; there are AI apps with images like midjourney and things like that; simple things or without creativity or critical or strategic thinking will be easy to generate; will see explosion of applications of this like with mobile computing or personal computing in 80s and 90s, early 2000s; will see Figma and Adobe incorporate this tech to make job easier but not billable","Yeah. Maybe for now only up to a certain level. My head of marketing always goes to chatgpt to translate text to English or to improve our English level or to generate a list of topics for blablabla, so she's a heavy user. I'm starting to see people use it in research, for instance to improve a script",No. We're at the point in which we just need to understand how far it goes. Any limits on that we haven't set any yet. ,"Not yet, but anticipates or hopes for one",,"It depends. We all know that it technically hallucinates. It invents facts if they are probable but unfortunately untrue. If there's a probability that fact will be true it says this is a fact. It makes things up if they are probable. But in tasks like improving text I just translated but I'm not very good in English, I think that's very good. So language is definitely something in which it's very good. ",n/a,"I don't think it's still clear but understanding where you should go... if you're in the beginning of the career you need to understand the basics, how do people do things. That's going to be really fast with this kind of tech, you just need to learn how to ask as we all learned how to search in google. Searching is a skill we all have been working on for a few years, we're just going to develop something similar which is how to ask. So maybe I have a problem and I'm not rationalizing my problem. If I know I have that AI tool close enough, I'll make the effort to make my problem rationally in my head so I can ask and can have an answer. So we'll develop that kind of skill but the improvement will be faster because it's not only having the info at an arm's length, it's having the knowledge at an arm's length. So it's not information, it's knowledge. The reason I don't yet use chatgpt everyday every time it's because many times I don't realize I can use it. I'm thinking about something, for instance I was thinking about a new device I've installed in my garden to measure the moisture of the ground to a watering device and I kept thinking about that and a couple days ago I said I can ask chatgpt about it. I did and the questions I had which I had been able to google in a distant and thorough way, I got answers, very organized answers. I still need to check them in case they are not just hallucinations. We still need at this point to have a very critical thinking on what we get. But if I read correctly what's coming next, they will reduce the level of possible hallucinations very fast, so I think my mother will trust this kind of tool completely. ","Absolutely. If you imagine that kind of bread and butter project that you can perform in automatic tools that will generate scripts for people to go through and get small rewards, yes. I think the whole process can be automated, yes. Please search this and that in that kind of field, yes. If it's bread and butter I would say yes. Probably you still need to supervise, to give the best inputs but I think if it's bread and butter mostly, sure. But on the other side, maybe we can aspire to have deeper studies that are composed of a number of smaller studies or things that relate one to the others. Maybe we can go much further. Maybe the business still is there for much deeper or frequent studies. I always felt that researching is something that we scratch the surface and we can customers to pay that scratching. We could've always gone much deeper, so maybe this tech helps us sell deeper studies. ","I know we will use them the tools more and more. I think they will be more and more human like, not in the shape but in things like how would a human advisor help me on these tasks. Is it something I ask that's a chatbox, maybe we're going to have voice, that's easy, chatbox plus Alexa. Question-answer is one easy way of doing that, but we'll see others, so maybe things like unsolicited advise. Something like if I had a friend behind me all the time. And more and more in specific tasks, if I'm a musician in a way that really makes sense to me, if I'm an engineer in a way that makes sense to me. So integrated in the tools I use in the way I feel more comfotable with. So if it's advise, if it's questions, if it's warnings, suggestions or something that the tech sees I'm going to do, a promptive advise at that specific point saying ""you can do it better and faster with this"". People will find ways of having the tech be present without me exactly soliciting the specific help. I think that will make sense to be available.","That's an everlasting question. Ethics and that side of tech and so on, the point in my view is that the human being has always been improving in terms of technology. The main problem now is the speed. We have been exposed to many technologies before and the reason why we're so afraid of that side of things is because of the speed of innovation. We're still humans, we're trained in acquiring and understanding technology, much better than our parents and grandparents, but still there's a limit. I think it's totally normal that we question the pros and cons of new technology and make a festival that it's going to be dreadful. The technology will mean the end of humanity, tha's normal in every technology. The question is that we haven't had time to finalize in the previous tech and we have a huge tech news that's going to explode that feeling. I'm very optimistic on tech. We humans will find the good ways of using tech. Of course we need to take care, but that's human invention as well. That's cat and mouse. We will be able to find the dangers and to prevent them. I'm thinking in general terms, I'm not talking of nuclear bombs. So yes, I think the turmoil has just started in terms of the dangers of generative AI. We're going to listen and read a lot about that. I'm very... it's very funny to see my daughters telling me that ""dad I used chatgpt to do my English homework"" and I'm like ""brilliant, that's it. Understand it, go through it"". No it's not a problem, I don't want their school to prohibit that and decide you cannot use it. It's the opposite, I think it's very good that they try it, understand it, they become very demanding on what it does. It reminds me of the times in the 90s in which the teachers were not savvy enough in terms of tech to understand that the calculator I was taking to the exams was not doing only sums. There was a lot more knowledge inside them. That was very good, that kind of steps are very good. I'm not on the side of people who forbid. ","M: what do next time you open chatgpt? P: I think I need to think of my hobbies and of the long lasting questions I have and review them and think which ones can I solve immediately. If not before, in case I need it professionally. 

M: anything else? P: No, we covered a lot, this is a great topic, we could spend the rest of the day here. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In portugal you usually get things in English then Brazilian Portugese - tried chat gpt in european portugese and it mostly worked, 90% in european portugese and 100% in brazilian portugese

Was searching for drop down box to choose the language, then asked chat gpt if it spoke portugese and was impressed that the conversation continued",n/a,,2-3x/week,,"podcasts, wall street tech news of the day podcast, portugese podcasts, google things to dive in, or chat gpt now","started to have internal conversations - org is research and design; chat gpt will make some tasks faster like transcripts, organizing scripts, creating/specifying simple designs, a design specification for bank apps; will bring value of simple human tasks close to zero, will have to see how professional services evolve with their market value

will have a learning curve for all tech other than chat bots; some things they do everyday will be do by tech, even design things; things that are simple, don't require creativity or stretegic thinking will be easy to generate

like mobile computing in the early 2000's there will be a big explosion of new applications; figmas and adobes of the world will integrate that tech to make our jobs easier but not billable",n/a,"yeah, head of marketing uses chat gpt for english translations or generating list of topics

people are starting to use it for research, generating interview scripts","no - they are at the point where they have to understand how far it goes, haven't set any limits yet",N/A,n/a,"depends - it technically hallucinates; it invents facts if they are probable, if there's a probablility that the info is true then it says it's a fact; in tasks like impoving text translations, it's very good; really good at language",,"for early career researchers, need to understand the basics of how people do things, this will be really fast w this tech as you just need to know how to ask, searching is a skill, if you have a problem you can rationalize it in your head and ask chat gpt; people will improve faster

he doesn't use chat gpt daily bc many times he doesn't realize he can use it - he recently asked chat gpt about a complex plant watering system that he wasn't able to google thoroughly, got immediate and very organized answers from chat gpt, but he still needs to check them

he thinks they will reduce hallucinations very quickly; his mother will completely trust chat gpt very quickly","absolutely - if you imagined a bread and butter project that you can perform in automatic tools that will generate scripts, the whole process can be automated

probably still needs human supervision and giving best inputs

maybe we can aspire to have deeper studies composed of smaller related studies, the business can maybe go further/deeper/more frequent, we've only scrated the surface of research, maybe this tech helps us sell deeper studies","people will use the tools more and more; they will be more and more human like not in shape but in how a human advisor help on tasks; question-answer is easy w voice, just pair alexa; maybe have unsolicited advice; completing specific tasks that is integrated into tools of different professions (musicians, engineers), giving advice to do things better/faster, having tech be present wo having to solicit specific help ","an everlasting quetsion - humans have always been improving tech, the main problem now is speed, we are so afraid of the dark side of things bc of the speed of innovation; humans are trained in acquiring and using tech much better than our parents but there's still a limit, normal to question pros and cons of new tech (dreadful, end of humanity), now we don't have time to finish the discussion of the previous tech when a new tech comes along

very optimistic about tech - humans will find good ways to use tech but we need to take care, humans will be able to find the dangers and prevent them

very funny to see his daughters telling him that they used chat gpt to do their english homework, he encourages them to try it and understand it to become very demanding about what it does; reminds him of in the 90s where teachers weren't savy enough to understand that calculators couldn't do extra functions","M: what's the next thing you want to do with chat gpt

Started from UX domain but also has a tutor, examiner, giving guidance to UX design projects as well. Still acting as a UX researcher and managing and directing UX design projects. And teaching as part time tutor in universities.",UX Director,21,"I'm one of the early users and adopters of internet because when I started university in 1992, internet also arrived to Turkey. The main provider in Turkey was our university campus, that's why I had very early... I had very good connection to internet because the university had modem rooms and we had IDM machines 1390. At that time internet was not based on user interfaces so had to learn Unix. Experienced very early GUI, we had atavista, we didn't have google yet. What we had to do was FTP, the only transferring method was FTP. First I rejected those easy GUI but then I had to accept it. So I'm very early user, in 1996 or 7 I built my own website using HTLM. I always try to use or learn about social media as well. We didn't have social media, but we had some products of google. Through google we could create our own websites, but we didn't have social media, but could create our own webpages and interact with people by creating content. We had to design our own homepage layout but with the introduction of of facebook we started to have printed layout, we didn't have to design ourselves. I'm still using internet.",,,"Yes, I am. I'm not writing code, but in 87 my father bought me a comodor 64 with the basic programming language. I learned that and started to make small code. And then in secondary school I learned about pascal coding language and learned a little C++, a little java and some php because during my phd I needed to design an online questionnaire. I think we had survey monkey but very limited, so I had to design my own online questionnaire tool, so I had to code it myself and the interface. I did my masters degree in physics, so already some technical person and in my masters degree I had to write a code to simulate a temperature distribution and coded it in 4tron. So I'm always in tech but I find myself more comfortable and happy doing research on human side. That's why I left physics, so I switched to soft science. [rates myself as] 8",8,,"I'm very much into... I'm very happy about AI because I was very curious about machine learning and thinking computers to think. During my phd I collected lots of data and to analyze data we have classical statistical methods, but these methods, when you give data to those classical methods, they make lots of... you have to play with your data in order to use those statistical models because they ignore things, they don't learn. Then I heard about a guy who was doing... at that time it wasn't called machine learning, he was doing soft computing because you're not computing with exact data. Cause feeling, thinking, liking something was not an exact data, you have to talk about % and intervals, like you're asking me from 1-10, you try to quantify the data by asking those questions. When I feed the computer with this data it also tries to think about these numbers and tries to define soft knowledge within the intervals and that tries to learn the data and give an answer. But it doesn't ignore any point in the data space. So it looks point and tries to understand, tries to create some pattern. This was exciting for me, so I also wrote some codes. It's called SOM, self organizing maps, so you give the data to the computer and write those SOM codes and it makes clusters and tries to relate those clusters to each other. The computer learns and it's very exciting for me because my first experience, personal experience with sort of machine learning. Whether it's AI, the machine learns and it creates AI. So I was very curious about it. And in recent years, because the machine learning people or AI scientists create an algorithm and the computer power increase immensely, they discovered that instead of using CPU they could use GPU - graphical processing unit - because then you can make a parallel process in the data, so it increased the power of the computer. So it became quite popular and then I was amazed with the story of deep mines. Because we were witnessing the mental computer competition like deep blue. Chess has a lot of rules and you have to think about a lot of possibilities and computer is learning all these prossibilities and at that time the computer power, because they used super computers, made lots of calculations and make chess movements. But then in deep mines, they beat the go world champion and it was amazing because go has very... compared to chess, very simple rules, very few rules and endless possibilities. So it showed the power of and the level of artificial intelligence. And recently we came across chatgpt, it's amazing. I heard about it and a couple of weeks ago we had a meeting with one of our clients and the client told us he does lots of things with chatgpt. He said even I don't write standard reports anymore, I give it to chatgpt and it writes me a report. And then I was very curious and was amazed by what it did. My wife is a professor at a university and gives homework to students, so I told her just give me homework that I'm not aware of and then I'll show you my output. She gave me stuff I'm not aware of and I gave it to chatgpt and it created a report that my wife was also surprised and excited and she told me that she could also use chatgpt help her write her scientific paper. Two days ago I'm tired but I'm happy tired cause we had amazing moments in south of Antalia. One of our clients is owner of 4 big hotels, one golf center, the second biggest golf area of europe and a very big sports arena. All the sports people from all over the world come there for their training and they have rehabilitation centers. And one of American hockey player, he's second best in the states for his region, he was injured and he found this place and came here and stayed there for a month for recovery. They're trying to do some mobile education for people who spent time there. We are going to do the UX research and design. One of the patterns in this project is the software person who is going to code all these designs. He's also an expert in chatgpt and open AI. He's going to give a webinar and his idea is we're putting all these menus and contact, but he says instead we should put chatgpt. He also showed us the results of his gpt research, so we're discussing whether... we're not sure yet, we're in the design process. Today in mobile applications or websites we have this chatbox. Whether this chatbox will be powered by chatgpt only when you ask or we have information architecture and navigation design, some people navigate through your interface or some people just use the search. It will act like the search function, but it will be more. We're just trying to learn how to... we have to also learn about chatgpt 4, it also creates visual content. First we have to learn how chatgpt, because it is AI, it will learn and I believe it will update itself every now and then. So we learn and learn and learn its power. I'm trying to imagine the feature interfaces with the introduction of chatgpt. Maybe based on your interactions it will personalize the interface based on you and the interactions with you. We have to discuss if we should give fixed layout to users or let the user interact with chatgpt and chatgpt or open AI... It will also update the layout design accordingly through interaction with the user and chatgpt. We are very excited, I'm very excited and very happy that I'm going to work with technical people who can achieve it. Because if those technical people are not there, as UX people we are just imagining and it's not being tested or produced. Of course we always do wizard of oz techniques and we can always create prototype as if it is working in AI but inside we will have opportunity. On the other hand I'm also excited and curious about blockchain tech. In this research we're going to apply both. So a centralized blockchain technology plus AI. These are the buzz words. As UX people we are at a time of a sort of evolution and we will also see whether we are necessary or not. ",Positive,,ChatGPT,,,10 - very much interested,10.00,"9 because I know how it works, I interacted with it.

I speak their language so I appreciate what they do and we are doing what is missing in the domain because we are designing the interaction with the human side. After a while they start to talk. I'm going to go through Youtube, watching videos about it, visit the website for my university because I know experts in our university. I'll look at MIT open source, all sorts of data. If I'm curious. I'm an old school reader, book reader. I like books a lot. For information seeking I use every means. Even in social, if I discover that someone is expert I say I can google them, but I want to hear it from you.","Just trying to learn about ChatGPT 4, it will update itself now and then and will continuously learned. trying to imagine interfaces with integration of chatgpt and how can personalize interface based on interaction, should give fixed layouts or let user interact with ChatGPT and update layout accordingly","I don't see any disadvantages. for example like dystopias and humanities, I leave it to philosophers. The good use of it, with good intentions and good planning... if it will give harm to my own protection then I have to regenerate myself. Because I did it in my life, I'm not afraid of changing, learning new skills because... we did with industrial revolution, same thing. These are the breakdowns in human evolution. This is one of the points we will have a breakdown but we will regenerate ourselves. I once read a book about those unemployed or fired IBM computer people, how some of them broke but some of them tried to learn new skills. I think I'll be one of those who's going to learn new skills because I'm always... I bought some electronic kits trying to learn something about IOT. I don't see any disadvantage.

Now I feel late adapter after I saw people start to use it. I feel I was a late adapter. This was for personal usage like creating reports or homework, I realized that chatgpt is more powerful than google because in google you search something and google gives you links to information, you go into the info and read it and digest it, but chatgpt creates... I write ""write me a short survey about this and this"", for example last week, once I had a humidic sensor and connected it to arduino and found a code to measure the humidity in the environment. But I had to search for that code in google, then I typed in chatgpt ""write a code for humidity measuring with arduino"" and it wrote a code and explained the code. ""You should use this sensor, in order to get the input you should do this and that and connect it in such a way"". It didn't give me any visual but with chatgpt 4 it will also create a visual for me. So it's much more powerful than google search. I think it will have such an... on a personal level I already realized its impact and it's evolution and in the short term I think we will see how it will impact our industry and how we will start to design, not interfaces, but interactions. Not only interface design, but interaction design will also change. In 6 months I believe we will... especially in our company we will see the impact of generative AI. We'll see whether people will accept it or not, but we will see the impact. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to assess which of these platforms will be most beneficial on helping me to work or have fun. ",6.50,"M: has view of internet changed? P: I think not so much, it's just an additional fun thing to experiment. I remember I thought about actually you can use Dali to find something as simple as your presentation. Maybe sometimes you are doing an interview and you want to describe the household context of the respondent and you don't have a picture you can try Dali. That's what happened but the image turned out very robotic, it felt it wasn't very human yet. I was questioning I need to write a better prompt, I don't think it's going to work out if I want to use this tech yet for my work. Or maybe how could I educate myself to write a better prompt so that the tech can help me for work. I was toying around with the idea, but I haven't really used it as frequently as I wanted to, because there's still some gap of knowledge on how to use it in an efficient and good way.",n/a,,,n/a,,,"I haven't really gone to that point yet, but I'm pretty sure if I go like ""how to write a better prompt in Dali or chatgpt"" I'm sure there'll be lots of tutorials. Or I remember on LinkedIn a lot of people making this content like ""21 ways you can maximize your chatgpt"". So I was like ""a lot of people have been educating us about this"". But I haven't really thought about it, I haven't searched about it yet, but I know it's out there and if I want to search it one day, a lot of people are making tutorial on how to write a better prompt or how to use it efficiently for UX research for example","I remember trying chatgpt and it can help you write a resarch background, like write me a quick summary of this project maybe. I thought to myself ""maybe chatgpt can help us to do that"" and just last week I was participating in Jakarta service jam and we have to submit our... I was a mentor in that project and the group had to submit what is this idea we created. The group start using, because we had such a short amount of time, ""oh just use chatgpt to make just a quick, catchy caption"". When we have a short window of time it can help us generate a quick thing. Not a complex thing, I feel like how to make a better project timeline or administrative work it can help us. And as a researcher we can focus on solving the complex things or things we need more discussion with our peers. ","After you emailed me, it got me thinking about downside. It's a good thing we can outsource this administrative work, but it got me thinking about the future researcher, because even though those tasks are boring, what if the future researcher don't have the basic things they have to do. It got me thinking about the future batch of researchers. It also makes us, not lazy, but maybe trying to find a balance between which job should researchers focus on and where can we use it in companion to how we work","Not completely, we talk about it. We're using discord and we have this water cooler channel, we start talking about ""you know adobe is releasing this new thing"". We started talking about it, but we haven't really toyed around as a company. I know a lot of people in the company already knows about this, but we haven't gotten to the point where let's start experimenting with our projects. It's more an individual initiative. ","not yet anticipates I think regulations should be in place. Like I said it feels unethical. Not just in research agency like us, but in other companies and other industries there should be a set of rules or regulations like to what extent those gen AI are helping us in our work. I feel like, what if all this UX research agency are using it and then we have the same brief, what if the results are the same thing? All these gen AI are being fed with millions of data there'll be the probability that the result might be the same. Got me thinking there should be set rules or a guidebook, either in the company itself or maybe some sort of UX alliance can make principles or something. ","Not yet, but anticipates or hopes for one",,"I've only used it a couple times, I feel I've tried so many prompts. I still feel you have to polish it, so I give it 7 or 6. The results that come out of the gen AI is a good basis, but the caption or description is not good enough or accurate enough, so you still become the human editor at the end. So it's like outsourcing the basic thing. You have this paragraph, but then, yeah. I don't want to submit my work blindly on what the AI is doing.",6-7,"I think it's not so much that... for every new tech there's always this fear that they're going to be replaced, certain jobs will be dropped. I want to see it in a positive way, how this tech can enhance our work and help us have more time to learn about new things. I wouldn't say UX researchers job will be obsolete in 5 or 10 years, but maybe our role will be transforming or maybe there's going to be a new set of skills we need to adopt. If transcription or basic administrative things is being taken care of by AI then UX researchers can focus more on the synthesis side or how can we challenge the output given to us by AI. Confident our role will still be there, it's not going to be replaced, but it's like we're working hand in hand. I'm thinking about this non-dystopian thing","I don't think so. I still feel like even though at the end the companies are perfecting all the results coming out, I feel as a researcher I feel responsibility, I own this project, I still need to be the one managing it. I think the question is about feeling unethical, because imagine if all the research you plan out is being created by this gen AI, is it really your work or not? It feels unethical.","Starting from 6 months, I would say companies will start learning about how to use it and how to implement, what the best to implement it. Maybe we can assess it like actually we have a lot of problems translating or moving visually when notetaking, we do it verbatim and then moving it to the capture sheet. I guess companies should assess which part of the research process needs gen AI the most. In 5 years, I guess that's how I would see it, then in 5 years we'll still keep adding on how we can use it, but in tandem. I would still feel like they are helping us, not to the point they are taking over our jobs. I do still believe that UX researchers, we have the knowledge, like a cultural nuance, but something that AI won't be able to capture that. That's the reason why humans are still, when doing interviews it's going to be different than how AI interviews. Even though maybe they're going to perfect how the AI is talking, it doesn't sound very robotic, but cultural nuance and capturing micro things on respondents lives, it's something only humans can still do, not AI yet. ","I can actually picture 2 sides because I feel with gen AI, I don't think the regulations or the set of ethics are still in place yet. I feel like all these AI are moving forward very rapidly, but the intervention on goverment side isn't still in place yet. If in rules and regulations are still not set in stone yet, then we could go on into dystopian road. For example, recently I used this app called lanza where everyone is taking their profile pictures, they're stealing the artists' work. That's one example of ethics. To what extent, they're learning from the artist, but they're stealing from it. But there's also this not so dystopian, where we go hand in hand and they're helping them. I guess I'm more on the dystopian side. althought her is a glimmer of hope, I believe that with every new tech it should help us, but seeing what's happening right now and how different companies are doing it. I have a feeling they don't think about the unintended consequences when releasing all this gen AI, that's why we hear about all these different problems, like they're stealing artist's work and it's also harming different users.","M: What is the next thing you'd do with chatgpt or dali? P: I just want to use it for entertainment for now. I haven't seen to the point... I still want to wait for the next version of how they perfect it. I feel like now it's still in beta mode for work, so I'm not going to trust or outsource my work to gen AI now. But maybe something to sate my curiosity around it. Like different kinds of art or stories. I think it's more on my personal experimentation rather than it's going to be helping me for work right now. 

M: anything else? P: I guess this conversation sparked me. Like where do we sit right now as a UX researcher with all this tech. My reflection is how we cannot just say do the normal method because we need to reeducate ourselves again. Trying to find gaps or to what extent they can help us, but is there anything that this tech enables to do. I remember thinking ""robots can't replace creativity"" but look what happened, dali and adobe it's like the first thing that comes up is like ""oh shit"". So it's like artists can be replaced in a just a snap like that, it's very unpredictable, so I feel like as UX researchers, how can we deal with the uncertainty and look for different ways to scale up or trying to make ourselves relevant even though there's going to be new tech coming in.

M: As a researcher and beyond, how would AI be in your world? P: As a researcher I think it will be a great tool for analysis and for finding patterns and bigger data base than we can handle. For instance, if you take a week or 2 to find patterns in 20-30 interviews, these tools could do it almost instantly maybe.
